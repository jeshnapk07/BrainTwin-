# BrainTwin-

This is a Generative AI-enhanced virtual brain model that enables neurosurgeons to visualize tumor locations and their relationships with critical structures using MRI scans. This solution enhances MRI scan quality using AI, automates tumor segmentation, and generates a 3D virtual brain model to simulate surgeries before they take place. By leveraging cutting-edge AI innovations such as Stable Diffusion + ControlNet for MRI enhancement and MedSAM (Segment Anything Model) for tumor segmentation, it aims to improve medical imaging, support pre-surgical planning, and enhance accuracy in tumor localization. Additionally, this model creates a 3D MRI representation from multiple 2D JPG slices using OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for stacking images into a 3D volume, and NiBabel for saving the model in NIfTI (.nii.gz) format, which can be viewed in medical imaging tools like ITK-SNAP. The .gz file is then rendered using VTK, allowing doctors and researchers to analyze MRI scans in a 3D format for better visualization and diagnosis.
